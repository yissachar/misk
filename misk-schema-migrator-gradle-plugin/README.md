**[Module Documentation Pending]**

## Metrics
This module automatically generates metrics related to Redis. These metrics are defined by the `RedisClientMetrics` class, and are as follows:

| Metric                | Slug                                          | Description                                                                                                                                    | Labels  | Type                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Max Total Connections | redis_client_max_total_connections            | Max number of connections for the misk-redis client connection pool (configured at startup)                                                    |         | [Gauge](https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Gauge.html)         |
| Max Idle Connections  | redis_client_max_idle_connections             | Max number of idle connections for the misk-redis client connection pool (configured at startup)                                               |         | [Gauge](https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Gauge.html)         |
| Idle Connections      | redis_client_idle_connections                 | Current number of idle connections for the misk-redis client connection pool                                                                   |         | [Gauge](https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Gauge.html)         |
| Active Connections    | redis_client_active_connections               | Current number of active connections for the misk-redis client connection pool.                                                                |         | [Gauge](https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Gauge.html)         |
| Destroyed Connections | redis_client_pool_destroyed_connections_total | The total count of connections dropped from the pool. Connections are dropped when they fail validation, and may be in an inconsistent state.  |         | [Counter](https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Counter.html)     |
| Operation Time        | redis_client_operation_time_millis            | The time it took in milliseconds, as reported by the client, to complete an operation.                                                         | Command | [Histogram](https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Histogram.html) |
